# Sprint_4
In this file I did all Pandas Tasks from Kaggle which includes methods like:

•	read_csv(file location)
•	loc[]
•	iloc
•	series([],index=[])
•	apply() 
•	map()
•	sort()
•	concat()
•	join()
•	isnull()
•	agg()
•	rename()
•	replace()
•	fillna()

The explanation of each method:

•	read_csv(file location) :help in loading the dataset which we are working on it
•	loc[] and iloc[] :help in slicing the data to get any part from data and work on it
•	apply and map: help when doing a specific  function on the dataset 
•	sort :helps in sort data in descending or ascending order 
•	concat: help at merging data 
•	join : help at merging data but on specific index column
•	isnull():finding if there is missing values in your data to clean it
•	fillna():fill the missing cells with any values 
•	rename :to change the column name
•	replace :to change specific value from any cell you want
•	agg: to apply any aggregation function(min,max,mean……etc)
